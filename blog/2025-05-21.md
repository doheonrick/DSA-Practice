# Learning Reflection: 2025-05-21

## What I Did Today
- Defined a C++ function (`add`) and practiced input/output  
- Designed the calculatorâ€™s feature list (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

## Reflections
- I realized that getting comfortable with function structures will make it easier to understand LeetCode templates  
- Next, I will challenge myself to implement the subtraction and multiplication functions!
