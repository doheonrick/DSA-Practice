# Learning Reflection: 2025-05-22

## What I Did Today
- Created **calculator.h** and moved all function prototypes there.
- Refactored **calculator.cpp** to remove `main()` and only keep implementations.
- Updated **calculator_test.cpp**:
  - Added forward declarations and `#include "calculator.h"`.
  - Tested division by zero throws `std::runtime_error("division by zero")` and verified `e.what()`.
  - Added `assert(divide(9, 3) == 3)` for normal division.
- Practiced multi-file build:
  ```bash
  g++ calculator.cpp calculator_test.cpp -o test && ./test
