# Learning Reflection: 2025-05-21

## What I Did Today
- **Implemented core arithmetic functions**  
  Wrote four C++ functions—`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`—each taking two `int` parameters and returning the correct result.  

- **Handled division-by-zero safely**  
  Included the `<stdexcept>` header and made `divide(a, b)` throw `std::runtime_error("division by zero")` when `b == 0`. 

- **Wrote unit tests with `assert`**  
  Created a separate test file that forward-declares each function and uses `assert` to verify:  
  - Correct results for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
  - That dividing by zero throws an exception (tested via `try { divide(…,0); assert(false); } catch(...) { }`)  

- **Built a simple console application**  
  In `main()`, used `std::cin` to read two numbers and an operator, `switch` to select the right function, and `std::cout` to print the result or error message.  

- **Resolved linker conflicts**  
  Learned to avoid “duplicate `main`” errors by keeping test code and production `main()` in separate translation units.  

- **Updated documentation**  
  Added a feature list to `README.md` and drafted a daily learning log in the blog folder.

## Reflections
- Getting comfortable with **function declarations**, **exception handling**, and **IO streams** makes C++ feel more approachable. 

- Separating test code from production code is crucial to avoid redefinition issues and keeps the build clean.  

- Forward declarations can help link tests without pulling in unwanted `main()` definitions.  

- Clear documentation (in both `README.md` and blog posts) helps track progress and plan next steps.

### Next Steps
1. **Modularize the code**: move function prototypes to `calculator.h` and implementations to `calculator.cpp`. 

2. **Automate the build**: create a `Makefile` or `CMakeLists.txt` to compile and run tests with a single command.  

3. **Set up CI**: integrate with GitHub Actions to run tests on every push.  

4. **Extend functionality**: support floating-point operations or simple expression parsing.
